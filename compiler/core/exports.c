/*

 *
 *      ExportElmt list set up during  parse.
 *      (not kept in Module data struct)
 *
 *  SetExports runs through type, value & macro defs and sets the
 *  exported flag accordingly.
 *
 *  The exportsParsed boolean means whether the symbol "EXPORTS"
 *  was parsed - since if EXPORTS was parsed and the export list
 *  is empty, NOTHING is exported, otherwise if the "EXPORTS"
 *  symbol was not parsed (export list is empty) then EVERYTHING
 *  is exported.  If "EXPORTS" was parsed and the list is not
 *  empty, then mark each item is the list as exported and the
 *  rest (that are not in the list) as not exported.
