 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/07/12 19:34:30  leonberp
 * Changed namespace to SNACC and added compiler options: -ns and -nons.  Also removed dead code.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/10/24 14:54:52  rwc
 * Updated to remove high-level warnings (level 4 on MSVC++) for an easier build.
 * SOME warnings persist due to difficulty in modifying the SNACC compiler to
 * properly build clean source; also some files are built by Lex/Yacc.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/08/21 20:36:00  leonberp
 * First CVS Version of SNACC.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1995/07/25 19:41:34  rj
 * changed `_' to `-' in file names.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/10/08  03:48:46  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:49:15  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
