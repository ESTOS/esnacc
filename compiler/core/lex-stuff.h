 * Revision 1.3  2002/03/19 22:33:45  rwc
 * Updates to the DER encoding of SET OFs.  They now include all tag/length bytes, no
 * longer skipping them as before (in a mis-interpretation of the specs).  Also updated
 * the test routine to test this feature (modified an existing data array).  Tested!
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/08/21 20:36:00  leonberp
 * First CVS Version of SNACC.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/07/25 19:41:31  rj
 * changed `_' to `-' in file names.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/10/08  03:48:45  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/09/01  01:16:07  rj
 * decide upon type of yytext thru cxx macro provided by autoconf.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:49:13  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
