/*
 * compiler/back_ends/c++_gen/kwd.c - routines for determining whether a given str is a C++
 *             keyword
 *
 *    NOTE: this was hacked up really quickly.  It uses a slow linear
 *          search. A much better approach is to use a hash tbl.

 * Revision 1.3  2004/02/12 18:55:09  gronej
 * Stable SNACC
 * non optional choices, sets and sequences are now not pointers
 * merged with list code
 * all memory leaks within SNACC fixed
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/07/07 14:52:35  nicholar
 * Eliminated headers and cleaned up include references
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/08/21 20:36:06  leonberp
 * First CVS Version of SNACC.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1995/09/07 19:05:01  rj
 * where the C++ compiler has got the bool type built-in, let the C++ backend avoid conflicts with the new keywords.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1995/08/17  14:56:12  rj
 * bool added to the list of reserved words
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1995/07/25  18:22:40  rj
 * file name has been shortened for redundant part: c++-gen/c++-kwd -> c++-gen/kwd.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/02/17  20:10:40  rj
 * inclusion order fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/10/08  03:48:04  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/09/01  00:19:44  rj
 * snacc_config.h removed; more portable .h file inclusion.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:48:11  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
