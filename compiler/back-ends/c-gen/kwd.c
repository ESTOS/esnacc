 * compiler/back-ends/c-gen/kwd.c - routines for determining whether a given str is a C keyword
 *
 *    NOTE: this was hacked up really quickly.  It uses a slow linear
 *          search. A much better approach is to use a hash tbl.

 * First CVS Version of SNACC.

 * Revision 1.4  1995/07/25  18:45:38  rj
 * file name has been shortened for redundant part: c-gen/c-kwd -> c-gen/kwd.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/10/08  03:48:06  rj
 * since i was still irritated by cpp standing for c++ and not the C preprocessor, i renamed them to cxx (which is one known suffix for C++ source files). since the standard #define is __cplusplus, cplusplus would have been the more obvious choice, but it is a little too long.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/09/01  00:20:28  rj
 * snacc_config.h removed; more portable .h file inclusion.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/08/28  09:48:13  rj
 * first check-in. for a list of changes to the snacc-1.1 distribution please refer to the ChangeLog.
